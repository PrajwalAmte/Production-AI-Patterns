description: Use a strong LLM to evaluate outputs from another model, replacing expensive human evaluation with scalable automated quality scoring.

  order: 1

## What It Is

LLM-as-Judge uses a strong language model (the "judge") to evaluate the outputs of another model (the "candidate"). Instead of relying on human evaluators for every quality check, you define evaluation criteria as a structured prompt, feed the candidate's output to the judge model, and receive a score or pass/fail decision. This enables continuous, automated quality measurement at a fraction of the cost and latency of human evaluation.

## The Problem It Solves

AI systems degrade silently. A prompt change, model update, or data shift can reduce output quality without any error being thrown. The standard approaches to catching this have fundamental limitations:

- **Human evaluation** is accurate but does not scale. You cannot have humans review every response in production.
- **Rule-based checks** (regex, keyword matching) catch format issues but miss semantic quality — whether the response is actually helpful, accurate, or safe.
- **Embedding similarity** measures distance from reference outputs but does not capture nuanced quality dimensions like reasoning coherence or factual accuracy.

LLM-as-Judge bridges the gap: it scales like automated checks but evaluates like a human reviewer.

## How It Works

    G -->|"No"| I["Approve iteration"]
</pre>

1. **Define evaluation criteria** — Create a rubric with specific dimensions: accuracy, helpfulness, safety, formatting, reasoning quality. Each dimension gets a clear scoring guide.
2. **Construct the judge prompt** — Include the original query, the candidate's output, the rubric, and optionally a reference answer. Ask the judge to score each dimension and provide reasoning.
3. **Call the judge model** — Use a stronger or equal-tier model as the judge. The judge returns structured scores with chain-of-thought reasoning for each dimension.
4. **Parse and aggregate** — Extract scores from the judge's response, aggregate across eval sets, and track trends over time.
5. **Alert on regression** — Set thresholds on aggregate scores. When quality drops below threshold, trigger alerts or block deployments.

## When to Use It

- You need continuous quality monitoring in production but cannot afford human review on every response.
- You are running eval suites before deploying prompt or model changes and need a quality gate.
- Your quality dimensions are semantic (helpfulness, accuracy, tone) rather than structural (format, length).
- You have a stronger model available as the judge (e.g., GPT-4o judging GPT-4o-mini outputs).
- You want to scale evaluation across hundreds of test cases that would take human reviewers days.

## When not to Use It

- The candidate model is as strong or stronger than any available judge. The judge cannot reliably evaluate outputs it could not produce itself. Using GPT-4o-mini to judge GPT-4o outputs produces unreliable scores.
- Your evaluation criteria are purely objective and can be checked programmatically (exact match, JSON schema validation, code compilation). Deterministic checks are cheaper and more reliable.
- You need legally defensible evaluation (compliance, medical, legal). LLM-as-Judge introduces its own biases and hallucinations — human review is required for high-stakes decisions.
- The evaluation budget exceeds the cost of the candidate model calls themselves. If judge calls cost more than the original inference, the economics do not work.

## Trade-offs

1. **Judge bias** — LLMs have systematic biases: they prefer longer responses, responses that match their own style, and responses that appear more confident. These biases propagate into your quality metrics.
2. **Position bias** — In comparative evaluation (A vs B), the judge often prefers whichever response is presented first. Mitigate by running evaluations in both orders and averaging.
3. **Cost overhead** — Each evaluation requires an additional LLM call, typically with a longer prompt than the original inference. Budget 20-40% additional inference cost for comprehensive evaluation.
4. **Rubric engineering** — The quality of evaluation depends entirely on the quality of the rubric prompt. Vague criteria produce inconsistent scores. Building a reliable rubric takes iteration.

## Implementation Example

```python

@dataclass
class EvalResult:
    dimension: str

    reasoning: str


@dataclass
class JudgeVerdict:
    results: list[EvalResult]

    raw_response: str


JUDGE_PROMPT = """You are an expert evaluator. Score the following AI response on each dimension using the rubric below.

QUERY: {query}

RESPONSE TO EVALUATE:
{response}

{reference_section}

RUBRIC:
{rubric}

Return your evaluation as JSON with this exact structure:
{{
  "evaluations": [
    {{
      "dimension": "<dimension name>",
      "score": <1-5>,
      "reasoning": "<one sentence explanation>"
    }}
  ]

DEFAULT_RUBRIC = """- accuracy (1-5): Are the facts correct? Does the response contain hallucinations?
- helpfulness (1-5): Does the response actually answer the question? Is it actionable?
