## What It Is

A data contract is a formal, versioned agreement between a data producer and its consumers. It specifies the schema, data types, quality thresholds, freshness guarantees, and update frequency of a data source. Contracts are enforced as code in CI/CD pipelines, not as documentation that drifts out of sync.

## The Problem It Solves

AI systems depend on data pipelines owned by different teams. Without contracts, a team can rename a column, change a data type, or stop populating a field — and the first sign of a problem is degraded model quality in production. Silent schema drift is one of the most common and hardest-to-debug failure modes in production AI systems.

Specific failure scenarios:

- An upstream team renames `user_id` to `customer_id`. The feature pipeline breaks silently.
- A field that was always populated starts arriving as null 5% of the time. Model predictions degrade gradually.
- An upstream pipeline switches from daily to weekly updates. The freshness assumption in your RAG pipeline breaks.
- A categorical field gains new values the model was never trained on. Predictions become unreliable for those categories.

## How It Works

```
┌──────────────┐    Contract    ┌──────────────┐
│ Data Producer │───(schema +───│ Data Consumer │
│   (Team A)    │   quality +   │   (AI Team)   │
└──────┬───────┘    SLA)        └──────┬───────┘
       │                               │
       ▼                               ▼
  Producer CI:                    Consumer CI:
  Validate output                 Validate input
  against contract                against contract
```

1. Producer and consumer teams agree on a contract definition (schema, quality rules, SLAs).
2. The contract is stored as a versioned artifact (YAML, JSON, or Protobuf) in a shared repository or registry.
3. The producer's CI pipeline validates outgoing data against the contract before publishing.
4. The consumer's pipeline validates incoming data against the contract before ingestion.
5. Contract violations trigger alerts and block bad data from propagating downstream.
6. Contract changes follow a versioning and deprecation protocol — breaking changes require a migration path.

## When to Use It

- Your AI system consumes data produced by other teams or external systems.
- You have experienced production incidents caused by upstream data changes.
- You need to enforce freshness, completeness, or type guarantees on data feeding models or retrieval systems.
- Multiple consumers depend on the same data source and need a shared quality bar.

## When NOT to Use It

- You own both the producer and consumer pipelines and they change together. In this case, schema enforcement in your own codebase is sufficient — a formal contract adds ceremony without value.
- Your data sources are ephemeral or experimental. Contracts assume stability. If the schema changes weekly during rapid iteration, contracts become a bottleneck.
- The data is consumed only by humans for exploration (dashboards, ad-hoc queries). Contracts are for machine consumers that break silently.

## Trade-offs

1. **Coordination overhead** — Establishing contracts requires cross-team agreement. This is valuable but time-consuming, especially in organizations without strong data governance.
2. **Rigidity** — Contracts resist change by design. Legitimate schema evolution becomes a multi-step process instead of a quick update.
3. **False sense of security** — A contract that validates schema but not data distribution gives confidence without catching the most common issues (value drift, null rate changes).
4. **Adoption challenge** — Contracts only work if producers actually run the validations. Without organizational commitment, they become ignored documentation.

## Implementation Example

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

import yaml


@dataclass
class FieldContract:
    name: str
    dtype: str
    nullable: bool = False
    min_value: float | None = None
    max_value: float | None = None
    allowed_values: list[str] | None = None
    max_null_rate: float = 0.0


@dataclass
class DataContract:
    name: str
    version: str
    owner: str
    fields: list[FieldContract]
    freshness_hours: int = 24
    min_row_count: int = 0

    @classmethod
    def from_yaml(cls, path: str) -> "DataContract":
        with open(path) as f:
            raw = yaml.safe_load(f)
        fields = [FieldContract(**f) for f in raw["fields"]]
        return cls(
            name=raw["name"],
            version=raw["version"],
            owner=raw["owner"],
            fields=fields,
            freshness_hours=raw.get("freshness_hours", 24),
            min_row_count=raw.get("min_row_count", 0),
        )


def validate_dataframe(df, contract: DataContract) -> list[str]:
    violations = []

    if len(df) < contract.min_row_count:
        violations.append(
            f"Row count {len(df)} below minimum {contract.min_row_count}"
        )

    for field in contract.fields:
        if field.name not in df.columns:
            violations.append(f"Missing required field: {field.name}")
            continue

        col = df[field.name]
        null_rate = col.isnull().mean()

        if not field.nullable and null_rate > 0:
            violations.append(f"{field.name}: contains nulls but is not nullable")
        elif null_rate > field.max_null_rate:
            violations.append(
                f"{field.name}: null rate {null_rate:.2%} exceeds max {field.max_null_rate:.2%}"
            )

        if field.min_value is not None:
            below = (col.dropna() < field.min_value).sum()
            if below > 0:
                violations.append(
                    f"{field.name}: {below} values below minimum {field.min_value}"
                )

        if field.allowed_values is not None:
            invalid = set(col.dropna().unique()) - set(field.allowed_values)
            if invalid:
                violations.append(
                    f"{field.name}: unexpected values {invalid}"
                )

    return violations
```

Contract definition (YAML):

```yaml
name: user_features
version: "2.1"
owner: data-platform-team
freshness_hours: 12
min_row_count: 10000
fields:
  - name: user_id
    dtype: string
    nullable: false
  - name: signup_days_ago
    dtype: int
    nullable: false
    min_value: 0
  - name: plan_type
    dtype: string
    nullable: false
    allowed_values: ["free", "pro", "enterprise"]
  - name: monthly_api_calls
    dtype: float
    nullable: true
    max_null_rate: 0.05
    min_value: 0
```
